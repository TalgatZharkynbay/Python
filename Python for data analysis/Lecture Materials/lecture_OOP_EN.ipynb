    "## Object Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software development methodology that is based on the concept of a class and an object, while the program itself is created as a collection of objects that interact with each other and with the outside world. Every object is an instance of some class. Classes form hierarchies. Classes, like functions, are created and used for convenience and simplification of program development. You can read more about the concept of OOP at [Wikipedia](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5).\n",
    "There are three main “pillars” of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation means hiding implementation details, data, etc. from the outside. For example, you can define a class `refrigerator`, which will contain the following data: `manufacturer`, `volume`, `number of storage compartments`, `power consumption`, etc., and methods: `open/close refrigerator`, ` enable/disable`, but at the same time the implementation of how to directly enable and disable it is not available to the user of your class, which allows you to change it without fear that this may affect the user of the class \"refrigerator\" program. In this case, the class becomes a new data type within the developed program. You can create variables of this new type, these variables are called objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance means the ability to create a new class based on an existing one. In this case, the descendant class will contain the same attributes and methods as the base class, but it can (and should) be expanded by adding new methods and attributes.\n",
    "An example of a base class demonstrating inheritance is the class `car`, which has attributes: weight, engine power, fuel tank capacity and methods: start and stop. Such a class may have a descendant -`truck`, it will contain the same attributes and methods as the `car` class, and additional properties: number of axles, compressor power, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects that have the same interface to be treated equally, regardless of the object's internal implementation. For example, with an object of the class `truck` you can perform the same operations as with an object of the class `car`, because the first is the heir of the second, while the converse statement is not true (at least not always). In other words, polymorphism involves different implementations of methods with the same names. This is very useful when inheriting, when in a descendant class you can override the methods of the parent class. A simple example of polymorphism is the `count()` function, which performs the same action for different types of objects: `'abc'.count('a')` and `[1, 2, 'a'].count('a') `. The plus operator is polymorphic when adding numbers and when adding strings."
